# customer_segmentation
Data consists of information about your customers holding a membership card such as Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. This last one is a score based on customer behaviour and purchasing data. There are some new products in the market that you are interested in selling. But you want to target a specific type of clients for each one of the products.

We will use machine learning for this task . Particularly, clustering, the most important unsupervised learning problem, is able to create categories grouping similar individuals. These categories are called clusters. A cluster is a collection of points in a dataset. These points are more homogeneous in a cluster as compare to points belonging to other clusters.
We will use kmean clustering algborithm gor this task in this project.
